# HPC exceedance binary classification

Backgrounds
1) HPC has a main limitation such as time delay.
2) Culture-independent methods are fast and sensitive, but not valid for standard compliance. 
3) This model overcomes the time delay and culture dependence. 

Model description
1) Feed-forward neural network
2) Culture-independent data are used for the input variables
3) Supervised for binary classification of HPC exceedance (0, pass / 1, failure)
4) Training/validation data ratio = 7:3
5) Trained using consumer tap water samples, not valid for outlet water from treatment plants
